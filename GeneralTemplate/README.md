# Data Science Accelerator - *name of the accelerator.*

## Overview

*A brief introduction of the acclerator.* 

The repository contains three parts

- **Data** This contains the provided sample data. 
- **Code** This contains the R development code. They are displayed in R markdown files which can yield files of various formats. 
- **Docs** This contains the documents, like blog, installation instructions, etc. 

## Business domain

*Business domain of the data science problem. For example, predictive maintainence, customer churn, etc. It is better to use keywords instead of verbose description.*

## Data science problem

*How the problem is formalized. For instance, a data science problem in a preditive maintenance application scenario may be to predict whether a machine is going to fail in operation after a certain number of running cycles.*

## Data understanding

*A brief introduction of data used in the problem. Dont' have to be verbose as more detailed introduction will be put in the directory of /Data.*

## Modeling

*How statistical or machine learning techniques are applied to resolve the data science problem.* 

## Solution architecture

*Overall solution architecture of the accelator. For instance, how a development pipeline is architectured for data pre-processing, model creating, and model deploying, for the data science problem.*
